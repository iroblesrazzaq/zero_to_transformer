# Neural Network Implementation Testing Guide

This document explains how to use the provided test suite to implement your neural network from scratch following a test-driven development (TDD) approach.

## Overview

Test-driven development involves writing tests first, then implementing the code to make those tests pass. This approach:

1. Forces you to think about requirements before coding
2. Ensures your code meets specifications
3. Provides immediate feedback on your implementation
4. Makes debugging easier by isolating failures

## Getting Started

### Files

- `neural_network_tests.py`: Contains all test cases for each component of the neural network
- `test_runner.py`: Script to run tests selectively as you implement each component

### Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Place the test files in your project directory alongside your neural network implementation file.

3. If your implementation is not named `neural_network.py`, update the import statement in the test file.

Note: The test runner uses colorama for colored terminal output to make it easier to see which tests pass or fail.

## Development Workflow

For the best learning experience, follow this step-by-step approach:

### 1. Start with the Layer Class

The Layer class is the foundation of your neural network. Begin by implementing:

```bash
python test_runner.py layer
```

This runs three test classes:
- `TestLayerInitialization`: Verifies correct weight and bias initialization
- `TestLayerForward`: Tests the forward pass computation
- `TestLayerBackward`: Tests the backward pass gradient computation

Implement each aspect in this order before moving to the next component.

### 2. Implement ReLU Activation

After completing the Layer class, move on to the ReLU activation:

```bash
python test_runner.py relu
```

This runs:
- `TestReLUForward`: Tests the ReLU forward pass
- `TestReLUBackward`: Tests the ReLU backward pass

### 3. Implement Softmax Activation

Next, implement the Softmax activation function:

```bash
python test_runner.py softmax
```

This runs `TestSoftmaxForward` to verify your implementation handles the numerical stability concerns and properly normalizes the output.

### 4. Implement Cross-Entropy Loss

Then, implement the loss function:

```bash
python test_runner.py loss
```

This tests:
- `TestCrossEntropyLoss`: Tests the forward pass loss calculation
- `TestCrossEntropyLossBackward`: Tests the gradient computation

### 5. Implement Neural Network Class

Now, assemble the neural network class that connects all components:

```bash
python test_runner.py network
```

This runs:
- `TestNeuralNetworkForward`: Tests the forward propagation through all layers
- `TestNeuralNetworkBackward`: Tests the backward propagation of gradients

### 6. Implement Training Logic

Implement the training functionality:

```bash
python test_runner.py training
```

This tests:
- `TestNeuralNetworkTraining`: Tests the training step and overall training process
- `TestNeuralNetworkPredict`: Tests the prediction functionality

### 7. End-to-End Testing

Finally, run the end-to-end test to verify the entire network works together:

```bash
python test_runner.py endtoend
```

This runs `TestEndToEnd` which performs a complete training and evaluation cycle.

### 8. Run All Tests

After implementing all components, run the full test suite:

```bash
python test_runner.py all
```

This verifies that all components work together properly.

## Test Descriptions

### Layer Tests

- **Weight Initialization**: Tests if weights are properly initialized with He initialization and biases are set to zeros
- **Forward Pass**: Tests the matrix multiplication and shape preservation
- **Backward Pass**: Tests gradient computation for weights, biases, and inputs

### ReLU Tests

- **Forward Pass**: Tests if ReLU correctly passes positive values and zeros negative values
- **Backward Pass**: Tests if gradients are correctly zeroed out for negative inputs

### Softmax Tests

- **Forward Pass**: Tests if outputs sum to 1 and numerical stability for large inputs
- **Output Ratios**: Tests if probability ratios are correctly calculated

### Cross-Entropy Loss Tests

- **Loss Calculation**: Tests if loss is small for good predictions and large for bad predictions
- **Numerical Stability**: Tests robustness against extreme values
- **Gradient Computation**: Tests if gradients are correctly calculated

### Neural Network Tests

- **Sequential Forward**: Tests data propagation through multiple layers
- **Backward Propagation**: Tests gradient propagation through the network

### Training Tests

- **Training Step**: Tests parameter updates for a single training step
- **Loss Improvement**: Tests if loss decreases during training
- **History Tracking**: Tests if metrics are correctly tracked

### Prediction Tests

- **Output Shape**: Tests if predictions have the expected shape
- **Prediction Values**: Tests if the highest probability class is selected

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Shape Mismatch**: Double-check matrix dimensions in computations
- **NaN/Inf Values**: Implement numerical stability measures (like in Softmax)
- **Gradient Explosion**: Verify your weight initialization and normalization
- **Slow Convergence**: Check learning rate and batch size

## Beyond the Tests

After passing all tests, you can:

1. Train on the full MNIST dataset
2. Experiment with different architectures
3. Implement additional features like dropout or batch normalization
4. Visualize training progress and learned features

Remember that test-driven development is iterative - focus on making one test pass at a time!
